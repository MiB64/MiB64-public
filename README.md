# MiB64

MiB64 is a free and open-source emulator for the Nintendo 64 and is a continuation/re-working of the original [Project64 Legacy](https://github.com/pj64team/Project64-Legacy) project. It is written in C/C++ currently only for Windows (possible planned support for other platforms in the future).

At the moment, there are no binary releases available for download as besides logos, branding, etc. there haven't been any substantial changes from Project64 Legacy yet (we are however in the middle of a major core rewrite, so stay tuned for any future beta releases on the **Official MiB64 Website (https://www.mib64.net/)**. However, the source code at this stage is still open so anyone can freely make code contributions, report issues, etc. üòÉ
